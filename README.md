# MobiFlight_RPiPico_FW
Custom built MobiFlight firmware for a RPi Pico based home-cockpit.

Config files and repetitive tasks were sped up using ChatGPT, so errors (wrong names or properties) might be there.
They should be fixed with the project going on :)

# How to use
* It is required to use my custom MobiFlight Connector [https://github.com/Ragot-Pierre/MobiFlight-Connector](here)
* For direct use :
- Create a SymLink of A320_HomePit_RPico.board.json in your _MobiFlight\MobiFlight Connector\Boards_ folder
- Open the A320_HomePit_RPico.mcc with MobiFlight
* For developpers :
- Use Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO, the project should open and be already configured
- Wiki : TODO (maybe)
